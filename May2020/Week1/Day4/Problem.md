# Problem

__Number Complement__

Given a positive integer, output its complement number. The complement strategy is to flip the bits of its binary representation.

Example 1:<br/>
Input: 5<br/>
Output: 2<br/>
Explanation: The binary representation of 5 is 101 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 010. So you need to output 2.<br/>
 
Example 2:<br/>
Input: 1<br/>
Output: 0<br/>
Explanation: The binary representation of 1 is 1 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 0. So you need to output 0.
