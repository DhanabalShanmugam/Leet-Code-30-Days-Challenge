# Problem

__Cousins in Binary Tree__

In a binary tree, the root node is at depth 0, and children of each depth k node are at depth k+1.</br>
Two nodes of a binary tree are cousins if they have the same depth, but have different parents.</br>
We are given the root of a binary tree with unique values, and the values x and y of two different nodes in the tree.</br>
Return true if and only if the nodes corresponding to the values x and y are cousins.</br>
Example 1:</br>
Input: root = [1,2,3,4], x = 4, y = 3</br>
Output: false</br>
Example 2:</br>
Input: root = [1,2,3,null,4,null,5], x = 5, y = 4</br>
Output: true</br>
Example 3:</br>
Input: root = [1,2,3,null,4], x = 2, y = 3</br>
Output: false</br>
 
Note:</br>
The number of nodes in the tree will be between 2 and 100.</br>
Each node has a unique integer value from 1 to 100.
