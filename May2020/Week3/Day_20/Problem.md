# Problem

__Kth Smallest Element in a BST__

Given a binary search tree, write a function kthSmallest to find the kth smallest element in it.

Example 1:</br>
Input: root = [3,1,4,null,2], k = 1</br>
   3</br>
  / \  </br>
 1   4 </br>
  \  </br>
   2  </br>
Output: 1

Example 2:</br>
Input: root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,null,1], k = 3</br>
       5  </br>
      / \ </br>
     3   6 </br>
    / \  </br>
   2   4 </br>
  /  </br>
 1  </br>
Output: 3</br>

Follow up:</br>
What if the BST is modified (insert/delete operations) often and you need to find the kth smallest frequently? How would you optimize the kthSmallest routine?

 
Constraints:

The number of elements of the BST is between 1 to 10^4.</br>
You may assume k is always valid, 1 ≤ k ≤ BST's total elements.</br>
