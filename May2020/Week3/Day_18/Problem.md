# Problem
__Permutation in String__

Given two strings s1 and s2, write a function to return true if s2 contains the permutation of s1. In other words, one of the first string's permutations is the substring of the second string.

 

Example 1:</br>
Input: s1 = "ab" s2 = "eidbaooo"</br>
Output: True</br>
Explanation: s2 contains one permutation of s1 ("ba").

Example 2:</br>
Input:s1= "ab" s2 = "eidboaoo"</br>
Output: False</br>
