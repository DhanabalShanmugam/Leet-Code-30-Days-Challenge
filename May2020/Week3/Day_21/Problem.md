# Problem
__Count Square Submatrices with All Ones__

Given a m * n matrix of ones and zeros, return how many square submatrices have all ones.<br> 

Example 1:<br>
Input: matrix =<br>
[<br>
  [0,1,1,1],<br>
  [1,1,1,1],<br>
  [0,1,1,1]<br>
]<br>
Output: 15<br>
Explanation: <br>
There are 10 squares of side 1.<br>
There are 4 squares of side 2.<br>
There is  1 square of side 3.<br>
Total number of squares = 10 + 4 + 1 = 15.<br>

Example 2:<br>
Input: matrix =<br> 
[<br>
  [1,0,1],<br>
  [1,1,0],<br>
  [1,1,0]<br>
]<br>
Output: 7<br>
Explanation: <br>
There are 6 squares of side 1.  <br>
There is 1 square of side 2. <br>
Total number of squares = 6 + 1 = 7.<br>
 
Constraints:<br>
1 <= arr.length <= 300<br>
1 <= arr[0].length <= 300<br>
0 <= arr[i][j] <= 1<br>
