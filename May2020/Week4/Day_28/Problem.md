# Problem
__Counting Bits__

Given a non negative integer number num. For every numbers i in the range 0 ≤ i ≤ num calculate the number of 1's in their binary representation and return them as an array.

Example 1:<br>
Input: 2<br>
Output: [0,1,1]<br>

Example 2:<br>
Input: 5<br>
Output: [0,1,1,2,1,2]<br>


Follow up:<br>
* It is very easy to come up with a solution with run time O(n*sizeof(integer)). 
* But can you do it in linear time O(n) /possibly in a single pass?
* Space complexity should be O(n).
* Can you do it like a boss? Do it without using any builtin function like __builtin_popcount in c++ or in any other language.
